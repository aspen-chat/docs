# Introduction

This is a high level overview of our goals and values. Specific technical decisions are out of scope, this merely serves as a guideline for how the technology should be built.

## Values

1. **A rising tide lifts all boats.** It is our belief that excellent secure instant messaging, multimedia calls, screen sharing, file sharing, and community management should be universal capabilities.
   These technologies should not be bound to a for-profit company, should not be provided by proprietary software, and should be trivially available to anyone who has a need for them.
2. **Universal Access is essential.** Anyone who wants to use our software should be able to do so. We will provide the best possible user experience to all humans, regardless of
   disability or language.

   2.a. We do not, and indeed cannot, control who uses our software and what purpose they use it for. We build this software the benefit of all, and this
   means that even people we disagree with will benefit from it too. However, this does not mean that we have an obligation to cooperate with or provide support to those who would seek
   to harm us.
3. **Through education, we achieve empowerment.** Any motivated individual should be able to use our software. We will not ever ask our users, even our server managers, to rely on secret
   knowledge. To the furthest extent of our abilities we will explain what needs to happen in order to facilitate the desired usage. What does this mean? Error messages should be crystal
   clear, and as specific as possible. Poorly explained errors are anathema. Unclear or nonexistent documentation is anathema. A user interface that is not self explanatory is anathema.

4. **Always prioritize the end-user experience.** If a trade-off exists between ease of development and the end-user experience, we will always choose the joy of the user over the joy
   of the developer. We seek to build the a comprehensive and feature complete software. As developers, we will not compromise this even if it makes our lives harder.
